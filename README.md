## Introduction

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, work and studies have shifted online with working on laptops from home. Being in lockdown and studies being remote students have started spending long hours in front of laptops camped out on bed, kitchen countertops or tables. Due to bad postures, people are experiencing new aches and physical strain especially lower back pains more commonly.  This ignited our curiosity on whether people with certain body structure are more susceptible to have lower back pain and led to the topic for this project.
The bottom part of the back or lumbar spine has network of spinal muscles, interconnected bones, nerves and is connected to the pelvis, working in tandem. Generating lots of movements and bearing the weight of the upper body, the lower back becomes vulnerable to pain. Though one of the most common type of pain, lumbago (lower back pain) can be acute or chronic. It could be indications of degenerative or nerve and spinal problems. (Akhil Chhatre, n.d.) (John Peloza, 2017)
Lower back pain may also be caused by damages in joints, ligaments or degenerating intervertebral disc or irritation in the different components of the back. In this project, we differentiate body structures as being normal and abnormal, thereby determining susceptibility to lower back pain, based on the physical attributes of the spine and pelvis. With the information contained in the independent features or predictor variables, and the dependent variable being binary, the focus of this project would be to classify or predict the type of body structure of person using robust Bayesian binary Logistic Regression analysis methods.
